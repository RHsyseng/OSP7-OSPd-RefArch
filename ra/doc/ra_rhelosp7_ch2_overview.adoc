== Architecture Overview
{osp} ({ro}) delivers an integrated
foundation to create, deploy, and scale an OpenStack cloud. {ro}
7, Red Hat's 5th iteration of OpenStack Platform, is based on the
community Kilo OpenStack release. This version introduces {ro}
director, Red Hat's new deployment toolchain. {ro} director combines
functinality from the upstream `TripleO` and `Ironic` projects
with components from Red Hat's previous installers.

{eapver} (EAP) is a fully-certified Java EE platform to quickly deploy and
develop enterprise applications. This reference architecture describes
a realistic use case for deploying an EAP 6 Microservices Architecture
(MSA) on a high availability {ro} 7 cluster. A microservices architecture is a
modular enterprise application where individual instances or
containers run single services and communicate via lightweight
protocols and APIs. The EAP 6 MSA used in this reference architecture
is a multi-tier shopping cart that processes customer transactions and
logs them in a backend database.


The complete reference architecture use case provides a comprehensive,
end-to-end example of deploying a {ro} 7 cloud on baremetal using
OpenStack director then implementing the microservices architecture via
`Heat` templates. This reference architecture complements existing
{ro} documentation by providing a _comprehensive example_ of deploying
a complex enterprise web application on OpenStack, demonstrating {ro}
7's features and tools in a realistic context.

The first section of this reference architecture introduces the principal
components: {ospver}, {ro}
director, and a microservices architecture built with {eapver}. It
also describes Red Hat's approach to making OpenStack high
availability. Core OpenStack services are managed and monitored in a
High Availability (HA) cluster. A load balancer provides access to the
service endpoints. There are no direct connections from the clients to
the the services. This approach allows administrators to manage,
operate, and scale services together or independently.

The second section of the paper describes the lab
environment, hardware, and software used to implement and test the
reference architecture.

The third section documents the installation
and configuration procedure. All of the steps listed in this document
were performed by the Red Hat Systems Engineering team. The
complete use case was deployed in the Systems Engineering lab on bare
metal servers using {ro} director and generally available code.
