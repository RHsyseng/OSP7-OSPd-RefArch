== Architecture Overview
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7 delivers an integrated
foundation to create, deploy, and scale an OpenStack cloud. RHEL OpenStack Platform
7, Red Hat's 5th iteration of OpenStack Platform, is based on the
community Kilo OpenStack release. Red Hat JBOSS Enterprise Application
Server 6 is a fully-certified Java EE platform to quickly deploy and
develop enterprise applications. This reference architecture describes
a realistic use case for deploying an EAP 6 microservices architecture
on a highly available RHEL OpenStack Platform 7 cluster. It provides a comprehensive,
end-to-end example of depoying an Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7 cloud on baremetal using
OpenStack director then implementing the microservice architecture via
`Heat` templates.

The first section of this reference architecture introduces the principal
components: Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7, OpenStack
Platform director, and a microservices architecture built with Red Hat JBOSS
Enterprise Application Platform 6. It also describes Red Hat's
approach to making OpenStack highly available. The second section of
the paper describes the lab environment, hardware, and software used to
implement and test the reference architecture. The third section
documents the installation and configuration procedure as performed by the
Red Hat Systems Engineering team to deploy the reference architecture in their
lab on bare metal servers using OpenStack director and production code. This
reference architecture complements existing RHEL OpenStack documentation by
providing a realistic, comprehensive example of a complete deployment.
