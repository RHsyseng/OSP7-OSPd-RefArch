== Architecture Overview
{rhelosp} ({ro}) delivers an integrated
foundation to create, deploy, and scale an OpenStack cloud. {ro}
7, Red Hat's 5th iteration of OpenStack Platform, is based on the
community Kilo OpenStack release. {eapver} (EAP)
is a fully-certified Java EE platform to quickly deploy and
develop enterprise applications. This reference architecture describes
a realistic use case for deploying an EAP 6 microservices architecture
on a high availability {ro} 7 cluster. It provides a comprehensive,
end-to-end example of deploying a {ro} 7 cloud on baremetal using
OpenStack director then implementing the microservices architecture via
`Heat` templates.

The first section of this reference architecture introduces the principal
components: {ospver}, {ro}
director, and a microservices architecture built with {eapver}. It
also describes Red Hat's approach to making OpenStack high
availability. The second section of the paper describes the lab
environment, hardware, and software used to implement and test the
reference architecture. The third section documents the installation
and configuration procedure as performed by the Red Hat Systems
Engineering team to deploy the reference architecture in their
lab on bare metal servers using OpenStack director and production code. This
reference architecture complements existing {ro} documentation by
providing a realistic, comprehensive example of a complete deployment.
