== Reference Architecture Configuration Details
This section of the paper discusses the reference architecture use
case. It includes an overview of the objective and workflow. This
section also describes the test environment used to execute the use
case in the Red Hat Systems Engineering lab.

=== Objective
This use case provides a comprehensive example for deploying an
{eapver}
microservices architecture on a high availability {ospver}
cloud using {ro}  director. The Red Hat Systems Engineering team
validated all commands on bare metal servers using generally available
software. The use case highlights many of {ro} director's features
including:

* High Availability
* Network isolation
* Advanced Profile Matching
* Ceph integration
* Ceph customization
* Satellite subscription

The use case concludes with instructions for installing the EAP 6
microservices architecture via `Heat`. The microservices architecture
demonstrates OpenStack's ability to deploy and run a complex
application typical to a production cloud. The microservices
architecture in this example is a multi-tier shopping cart that
includes a web presentation layer, product and customer databases, and
sales, billing, and product microservices.

=== Workflow
Figure 4.1 <<reference-workflow>> depicts a high-level overview of the use case
workflow.

The use case is divided into the following steps:

. *Install the undercloud*:
.. Download the {ro} deployment package.
.. Deploy the undercloud baremetal server.
. *Prepare the overcloud*:
.. Import overcloud disk images.
.. Discover baremetal servers for overcloud deployment.
.. Match the servers to hardware profiles.
.. Customize the Ceph OSDs.
.. Define the network isolation configuration.
. *Create the overcloud*: 
.. Deploy the overcloud via `Heat` templates.
.. Configure HA fencing devices.
.. Test the overcloud deployment.
. *Deploy the EAP 6 MSA*:
.. Configure the tenant
.. Deploy EAP 6 microservices application via `Heat` templates
.. Test the application

=== Conceptual Diagram of the Solution Stack
Figure 4.2 <<reference-architecture-diagram>> depicts the deployed solution stack
including, server roles, and service placement.

The <<network-topology-section>> section of this paper describes the networking components in detail.

==== Server Roles
As depicted in Figure 4.2 <<reference-architecture-diagram>>, the use case requires 12
bare metal servers deployed with the following roles:

* 1 undercloud server
* 3 cloud controllers
* 4 compute nodes
* 4 Ceph storage servers

Servers are assigned to roles based on their hardware characteristics.

Appendix C <<Appendix-hardware-specifications>> lists hardware specifics for each server
model.

[[network-topology-section]]
==== Network Topology
Figure 4.2 <<reference-architecture-diagram>> details and describes the network topology of this
reference architecture.

Each server has two Gigabit interfaces (nic1:2) and two 10-Gigabit
interfaces (nic3:4) for network isolation to segment OpenStack
communication by type.

The following network traffic types are isolated:

* Provisioning
* Internal API
* Storage
* Storage Management
* Tenant
* External

There are six isolated networks but only four physical interfaces.
Two networks are isolated on each physical 10 Gb interface using a
combination of tagged and native VLANs.

NOTE: The {ro} 7 network isolation feature supports bonded interfaces.
Limitations in the Systems Engineering lab precluded the use of bonded
interfaces in this reference architecture. Bonded interfaces are
recommended for production deployments.

NOTE: All switch ports must be added to their respective VLANs prior to
deploying the overcloud.

Deciding how to isolate networks is a crucial decision when
designing for performance and scalability. There is
no one-size-fits-all approach. Hardware constraints and workload
characteristics must dictate this design decision.

https://access.redhat.com/articles/1507893[This paper] shares an approach
to using cloud benchmarks to guide {ro} design decisions for
performance and scaling.
