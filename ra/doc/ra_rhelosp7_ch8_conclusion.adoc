== Conclusion
OpenStack Platform 7 is Red Hat's 5th iteration of OpenStack Platform
based on the Kilo community OpenStack release. This reference
architecture is a comprehensive example of deploying an EAP6
microservices application on a RHEL 7 OpenStack cluster. It provides a
comprehensive example for deploying an application end-to-end on
realistic hardware using customer-available code. The use case
provides a frame of reference for customizing the storage and
networking. The reference architecture also introduces OpenStack director --
Red Hat's intergrated management tool set -- and describes Red Hat's
approach to OpenStack high availability.

Future extensions to this use case might include using `keepalived`
instead of `Pacemaker` for HA, auto-scaling the EAP application with
`Heat` and `Ceilometer`, and implementing Neutron LBaaS in front of a
scaled EAP 6 application.
